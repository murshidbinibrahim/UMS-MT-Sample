# Planning to do some intersting things

Authentication and Authorization: Implement a secure authentication mechanism for user login and registration. Use techniques like JSON Web Tokens (JWT) for authentication and role-based access control (RBAC) for authorization.

User Registration and Profile Management: Design a user registration form where users can create new accounts. Allow users to manage their profile information, such as updating their personal details, changing passwords, and uploading profile pictures.

User Roles and Permissions: Define different user roles (e.g., admin, regular user) and assign appropriate permissions to each role. Implement functionality to restrict access to certain parts of the application based on user roles.

User Dashboard: Create a user dashboard that provides an overview of the user's account information and relevant actions they can take. This could include displaying user-specific data, recent activities, and options to manage their account.

User Listing and Search: Develop a feature to list and search for users within the system. Implement filters and sorting options to allow users to find specific users based on criteria like name, email, or role.

User Activity Logging: Implement a logging mechanism to track important user activities within the system, such as user login/logout, profile updates, and password changes. This can help with auditing and troubleshooting.

Password Reset: Include a password reset functionality that allows users to request a password reset link via email. Upon clicking the link, users should be able to securely reset their passwords.

Email Notifications: Incorporate email notifications to send important communications to users, such as welcome emails, password reset notifications, or account-related updates.

User Feedback and Support: Provide a way for users to provide feedback or seek support within the application. This could be through a contact form, live chat, or integration with a support ticketing system.

Responsive Design: Ensure your user management system is responsive and mobile-friendly, allowing users to access and interact with the application seamlessly across different devices and screen sizes.
